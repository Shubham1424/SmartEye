# Smart-Eye

Creating and Developing an application "Smart Eye" which will help the user in observing the activities of the vehicles at a Plant/Site and maintaining their records. It will keep track on the movements of the vehicles and their drivers. The application will also provide service of determining the current status(In/Out) of the vehicle. The application will assist the stakeholders for remote monitoring of vehicles. The stakeholders can keep a watch on the movement of the vehicles without physically being present there.

Applications ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

⦁ We can use this system in the places where the security is required on daily basis.

⦁ It can Scan Number Plates , Detect faces, maintain records and track vehicles as required.

⦁ It can be useful in fields where it is necessary to maintain entries for vehicle and people etc.

⦁ It can be used in Residential societies , various sites like construction and companies, parking areas and private spaces etc.

⦁ This App stores the record and these records can be used to review activity and security purpose.

Major objectives -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

1.Scan – Vehicles and Drivers (Face Scan, Number Plate Scan).
2.Report – Make Overall Reports of Activity of the Vehicles.

Proposed Algorithms ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
1.Face Detection - 1) CNN(convolutional neural network) | Keras Efficient Net Model
                   2) Classification & Feature Extraction using Layers 
                   3) Open-CV Cascade Classifier 
                   4) Creating Tf-lite Model 
                   5) Tenserflow Lite v3.1.2

2.Number-Plate Recognition - 1) ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Detection) 
                             2) OCR(Optical Character Recognition) 
                             3) Text Recognition using OCR 
                             4) Text Formatting

3.Database Handling - 1) Android Studio 
                      2) Firebase Realtime Database 
                      3) Add, Remove, Delete, Update

TEST CASES ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

⦁ Password Length: The password length must be at least 6 characters for login, if you enter a lower no of characters then it will show an error.

⦁ Login Failure: If user enter any of the wrong details of username and password then it will show login failure.

⦁ Empty Fields: The fields must not be empty it should contain some valid data to further store in database.

⦁ Existence : If user enters any wrong details of vehicle then it shows the existence error i.e. The vehicle does not exists!!.
